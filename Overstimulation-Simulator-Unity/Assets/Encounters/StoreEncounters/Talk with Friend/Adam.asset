  encounterText:
  - Adam looks up from his phone. His brow furrows as he makes out who you are. 'DON'T
    YOU SEE I'M ON BREAK?!' he says. His gaze pierces your soul as he waits for your
    response.

  responses:
  - Hysterical
  - You start to tear up, explaining you just wanted to say hi. 'I just wanted to
    be a good friend!' You don't see his expression soften as you look down and walk
    off... the damage was already done.
  - '''CAN''T YOU SEE I''M TRYING TO TALK TO YOU?!'' The two of you argue like this
    forever... you leave feeling worse than you did before.'
  - As if on instinct, you apologize... apologize faster than you can think... no
    amount of "sorry" can make up for your mistake. You run off.
