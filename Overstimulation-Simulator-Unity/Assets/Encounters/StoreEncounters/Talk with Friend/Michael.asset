  encounterText:
  - Michael is wandering around the dog food aisle. His brow is furrowed and his
    expression is a frown. Seeing you, he begins to smile and his shoulders become
    less tense. He explains that he had gotten his first dog and would like your
    advice on getting supplies.

  nextQuestion: {fileID: 0}
  responses:
  - You smile, constantly congratulating Michael on his new pup. You almost forget
    you have your own groceries to attend to as the two of you spend a lot of time
    picking out supplies for the pooch.
  - Sad (Bad)
  - FRUSTRATED (pretty bad)
  - '"Wait, you''re a dog person?" you ask. He smiles, reminding you of the times
    you two talked forever about breeds you wanted to own. The whole thing goes smoothly,
    but you feel like a bit stupid for asking.'
