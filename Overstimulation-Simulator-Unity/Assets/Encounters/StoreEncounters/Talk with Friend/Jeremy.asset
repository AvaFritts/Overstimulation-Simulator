  encounterText:
  - Jeremy is buying flowers and a bittersweet card. He doesn't seem to notice anyone.
    After a while of trying to get his attention, he looks up, sorrowful. He tells
    you that his grandfather recently passed from disease, and the gifts are for
    his mother, who hasn't been the same since.

  responses:
  - You tell him that he's doing such a sweet thing. The card is adorable and the
    flowers smell lovely. You go on and on about how much those gifts much mean..
    you don't even realize how uncomfortable he's getting until he texts you the
    next day.
  - You pay your condolences, looking over the flowers they have for sale. You both
    spend the time reminiscing over what you once had, and smile since you still
    have each other.
  - You start muttering about how you never got a card when your grandfather died.
    All the time you spent with him... by the time you finish airing your grievances...
    Jeremy has long since left the store.
  - 'You continue to ask questions, most of which being in good taste. Then there''s:
    "Why would you need <i>that</i> card?" ...He looks at you, heartbroken. At least,
    until you point out the card is a "get well soon" card rather than a "sorry for
    your loss" card. You feel bad for some of the stupid things you asked, but tell
    yourself it was worth it.'
