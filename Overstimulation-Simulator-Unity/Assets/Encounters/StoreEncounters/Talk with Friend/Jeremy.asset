  encounterText:
  - Jeremy is buying flowers and a bittersweet card. He doesn't seem to notice anyone.
    After a while of trying to get his attention, he looks up, sorrowful. He tells
    you that his grandfather recently passed from disease, and the gifts are for
    his mother, who hasn't been the same since.
