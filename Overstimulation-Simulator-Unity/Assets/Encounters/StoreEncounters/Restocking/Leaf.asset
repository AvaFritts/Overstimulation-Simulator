  encounterText: Why aren't they responding? You've tried to get their attention
    for what feels like hours now. To make matters worse, they are blocking the spot
    your candy should be in!

  responses:
  - '"It''s okay!" you keep telling yourself. Over and over. It''s okay. It''s okay.
    People start to look at you weird as you walk away, eye twitching. You won''t
    see them again. No reason to get mad! It''s okay. It''s okay.'
  - You try to calm down, assuring yourself you can get this item tomorrow. But...
    it is all for naught. You run off and cry in a corner, making sure nobody can
    see your horrid tears. Oh, how you hate that sharp, ugly sound.
  - You start to yell. How DARE they block what you came here for! None of your yelling
    reaches their ears. You shove them out of the way, ignoring everyone staring
    at you as you check another item off your stupid list.
  - This item <i>is</i> on your list. You NEED to have it. Right? RIGHT?! You are
    trembling just thinking about it. Eventually, you cram yourself between them
    and the shelf, rip the candy out of its holder, and run off.
