  encounterText:
  - William looks at his PDA, shaking slightly as he searches his stock for the next
    box of candy. Looks like one wrong move could scare him.

  responses:
  - You carefully go into his view, smiling as you do what you trained yourself to
    do. You get the instructions, unable to forget how he smiled when you left. You
    feel good.
  - You try to get the courage up to speak, but seeing him tremble makes <i>you</i>
    to tremble. You decide to look for it yourself, enduring the store as it is.
  - Well... you scared him. You thought that tap and yell wasn't loud... but it was
    <i>very</i> loud. You go the rest of your day, wondering if you could have done
    better.
  - '"Um, excuse me?" You see him jump, but your quick apologies calm him down. You
    are able to get the directions as quickly as you could dream of.'
