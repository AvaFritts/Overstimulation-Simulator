  - "The clinging of metal drowns your ears as you walk closer to the cold booth.
    The butcher slams his knife as hard as he can, creating a cut so clean you would
    never tell they were both one piece. He slowly looks up, eyes cold and brow furrowed.
    \u201CAre you wanting something\u2026\u201D He says in a manner that singles

  - Furious
  - You know what? You don't need to get ham until next week... You quickly leave
    the deli.
