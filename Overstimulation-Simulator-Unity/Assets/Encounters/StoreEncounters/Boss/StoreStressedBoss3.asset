  encounterText:
  - The first lady storms off, allowing the second to close the gap. She has a monster
    of a child, tearing down the candy next to them and screaming about how they
    wanted some doll in the toy aisle. Eventually, she erupts, screaming at the child.
    All you can focus on are the tears in your eyes and the pounding in your chest.

  responses:
  - The argument between the two... you start to chuckle. The mom looks at you, confused...
    then pissed. She stops yelling at her kid and starts yelling at you. But you
    don't cry. You don't yell... all you do is smile. So much that you don't realize
    the line has moved on without you.
  - DISTRAUGHT
  - You start yelling at the mom. How horrible she's treating her child- how horrible
    her child is. Every issue you had today is unloaded onto the woman, causing both
    her and her child to shut up. Then... an argument erupts. The yelling between
    you and the woman gets worse... and worse... and then the security arrives. It
    doesn't matter who started it anymore. The two of you are both thrown out of
    the line.
  - PANIC
