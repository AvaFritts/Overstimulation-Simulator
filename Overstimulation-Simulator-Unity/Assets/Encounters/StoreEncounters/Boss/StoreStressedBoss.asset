  encounterText:
  - The swarms of beeps and conversations pry at what little sanity you have left,
    but you stand strong. Everything was going fine! ...Until the card reader broke.
    Voices were gathering, muttering about how you failed to do something so simple.
    Nobody "normal" would make this mistake, would they?

  responses:
  - You start to chuckle. It's okay! You aren't normal, and that's fine! Their words
    can't hurt you at all! ...but those words <i>do</i> hurt. You smile through the
    pain before giving up and looking for a new aisle.
  - CORRECT RESPONSE
  - The noises are choking you. No amount of covering your ears saves your sanity.
    You yell for the noises to stop, slam your fist into a box of candy, and stomp
    off.
  - You excuse yourself and run off to a new aisle. You almost forget your items
    in the process. Your heart is pounding, and there is no way you'll be able to
    handle this. You'll just find an empty aisle... right??
