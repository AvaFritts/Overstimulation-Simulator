  responses:
  - You start laughing, mocking her pathetic attempts to knock you down. She looks
    disgusted, and the two of you start to argue. Eventually, you are both thrown
    out of the line.
  - You burst into tears. She doesn't stop. It just doesn't stop. You take your bags
    and run off, trying to find a new aisle to use.
  - CORRECT RESPONSE
  - You curl up into a ball, screaming for her to stop. They have to drag you out
    of the aisle before you can calm down.
