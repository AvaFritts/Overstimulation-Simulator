  encounterText:
  - 'The Cashier waves as you approach their aisle, a small section of droning beeps
    and conversations. They smile while you put your items on the captivating conveyer
    belt. "Hello! Did you find everything you were looking for??" As you look at
    the list you folded in your bag, you realize: Yeah... you did find everything!
    Except for that <i>darn block of cheese.</i>'
  - '''Really? Well, I''m sorry. I hope you find it next time.'' Their attention
    slowly returns to the scanner as they bag the slow-moving supply of items. The
    rest of the time is uneventful, causing your eyes to wander... at least until
    they ask ''Are you a Stimmart Rewards Member?'' ...Since when did they have a
    rewards program?'
  - '''Well, all the information is on our website. Do you want to become a member?''
    You decline and follow the instructions on the machine as it yells at you to
    insert and remove your card. As you start to head out, they say one last thing:
    ''Thank you for shopping at Stimmart! Hope to see you again!'''

  responses:
  - CORRECT RESPONSE
  - You explain how you weren't able to find the cheese... then how your family loves
    this cheese... then it devolves into you wishing your childhood pet was still
    alive. You exit the line before you cry too hard.
  - CORRECT RESPONSE
  - You realize... you didn't check your list fully. You leave the line to cross-reference
    your cart with your list. Back into the mess of life once again...
