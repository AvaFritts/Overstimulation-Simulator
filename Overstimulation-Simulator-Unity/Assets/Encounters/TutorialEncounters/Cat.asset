  - Oh no! It seems like your overstimulated state has attracted your mischievous
    cat. Even if your panic makes it hard to act normally, you still only have one
    shot to get this right

  - Despite your panic, you try to act happy. ...It doesn't work. Trying to hide
    your fear only made it worse. But you kept smiling, knowing the cat enjoys your
    playtime. Even if you do get scratched a bit.
  - You shake as you hold your hand out. As the cat gets closer, you feel tears pouring
    out of your face. It isn't right. Your cat isn't a monster, but memories of being
    hurt... of blood seeping out of your arm... You hate the pain. But this cat is
    a good cat, and it deserves someone that isn't scared or struggling to smile.
    At least the cat can stay around until you calm down.
  - You start yelling at the cat to get away. As it gets closer, you start to push
    it away. When that doesn't work, you scream in fustration. Finally, that cat
    gets the hint and scampers off.... Only hours later would you shudder as you
    realize what a horrible cat owner you are.
  - You hold your trembling hand out.... but you soon retract it. You decide it is
    best to just put the cat food in the bowl and walk away. It was probably hungry,
    after all, even if memories of being harmed swarmed your vision. Those were accidents...
    right?
