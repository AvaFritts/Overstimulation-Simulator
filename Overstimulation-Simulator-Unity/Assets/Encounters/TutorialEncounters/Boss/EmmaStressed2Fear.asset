  - '*You chuckle, overwhelmed by the constant attempts to shove the intrusive thoughts
    out of your head. You fake a smile and say it will be okay, but you know it is

    but no matter what she does she can''t force it out of her head. She takes a
    few steps away from the mirror, sits down, and cries.*'
  - WHY DO YOU KEEP THINKING OF THIS, EMMA?! KEEP IT TOGETHER!
