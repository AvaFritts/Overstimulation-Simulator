  encounterText:
  - Your dog walks up, panting with that usual loving expression. It is a good reminder
    that he wants you to be happy. It is also a good reminder that you only have
    one shot to get this right.

  responses:
  - You happily pat your knees, watching as your dog sits as always. A good boy needs
    good pets, right?
  - You walk over and begin to pet... but you can only think about the pets of days
    gone by. A tear rolls down your face.
  - Ugh... of all the times your dog comes by... why now?! You're running late! You
    rush by, not even giving him the time of day. . . you'll regret that later.
  - Before you can even get your hand on the dog's head, you stop. Did you get all
    of your keys? Does he have enough food?
