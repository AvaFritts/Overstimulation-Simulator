  responses:
  - She is failing to keep it together. The laughing disturbs people, and Emma decides
    she will try to leave. She breaks free from everyone.
  - CORRECT ANSWER.
  - You punch Michael, leaving everyone to stare at you. He looks at you with betrayal
    written all over him, hand covering his nose. You walk off, hoping he will get
    the memo.
  - They have to take you by force. Everyone's eyes turn to look at you as you kick
    and scream, begging to be set down.
