  encounterText: Despite how loud the music was on the floor, the DJ booth was surprisingly
    calm. This was mostly due to the DJ, who has pumping his fist to the music whenever
    he could have it free. As you approach, he puts his hands on his computer. "Oh
    hey there lil' one!" He says with a smooth voice that almost blends with the
    music. "You got anything for me?"
