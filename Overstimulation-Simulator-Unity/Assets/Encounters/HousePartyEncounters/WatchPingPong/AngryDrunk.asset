  encounterText: The game was okay- the cheering hurt your ears. But the worst bit
    was that lady. She barreled through the door and started screaming at you. How
    you took her purse- her boyfriend- and much much more. It was all a blur... <i>but
    you didn't do it, right?</i>

  responses:
  - Your compliments and twitching eyes threw her off. She switched gears- saying
    you needed therapy <i>and</i> needed help. The situation was diffused... but
    at what cost?
  - You frantically apologize, tearing up on the fears of being wrongly accused.
    But she keeps going, taking your submission as validation for her invalid claims.
  - Without a moment to spare, you started yelling back. She was wrong- dead wrong-
    and you knew it from the start. The screaming match only ended when someone else
    found her purse.
  - The screaming hurt more than the cheering. You started screaming back, begging
    her to stop. You closed your eyes and covered your ears, praying for silence...
    when you finally opened them, the entire room was staring at you.
