  encounterText: '"Oh hey girlie!" A stranger''s voice catches your attention as
    a hand slopily grabs your shoulder. "You playing next?? You''d look sooooo good
    in there!" The girl lazily holds her drink, occasionally swaying in her skirt.
    "It''s a lot of fun. Trust me!" She doesn''t even seem to realize you two are
    strangers.'

  responses:
  - You're shocked how quickly she treats you like a friend. You accept the match,
    and it turns out your newest friend is a perfect hype girl.
  - You decline the match, listing personal reasons you cannot play. It doesn't feel
    great letting her down, but she quickly gets over it.
  - You try to ask her to stop touching her shoulder. She doesn't. Eventually, you
    snap. Not a big snap, but still enough frustration to get her to leave you alone.
  - You start asking a bunch of questions... even after she throws up on your dress,
    you decide to make sure she gets the help you need. Luckily, it gets you both
    out of the loud mess.
