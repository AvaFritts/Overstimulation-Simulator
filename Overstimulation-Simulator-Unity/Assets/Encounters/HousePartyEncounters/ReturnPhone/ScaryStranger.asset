  responses:
  - You smile and try to play it cool, but you are barely keeping it together.
  - You try to defend yourself, but the stranger swipes the phone out of your hands
    and walks off. You don't even realize you are crying until their words get out
    of your head.
  - You start yelling back, appalled that someone would even accuse you of such a
    heinous action. A crowd starts to form around you as the two of you begin a shouting
    match.
  - You can't even try to hide your emotions. You run to the fence, praying nobody
    heard the false accusations.
