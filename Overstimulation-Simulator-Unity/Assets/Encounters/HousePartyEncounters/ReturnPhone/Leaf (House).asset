  encounterText: They have a neutral expression from the moment you tap their shoulder
    to the moment you ask if they lost their phone. They slowly take it out of your
    hands, turning it over before unlocking it. A slight smile appears on their face.
    "Yeah... this is mine....... thanks."

  responses:
  - You nod, acknowledging their gratitude before swiftly heading off. Before you
    know it, you realize you're also smiling.
  - It's hard to register the happiness. You know they are, but it doesn't feel like
    it. You hand the phone and walk off, feeling like your efforts were unrecognized.
  - You are cold and uncaring back, ignoring the happiness because of how subtle
    it is.
  - You start asking questions, confusing the stranger farther.... but you two have
    a good conversation after that.
