  responses:
  - Your interraction is short and sweet, making sure you both know how you respect
    the other.
  - It's hard to register the happiness. You know they are, but it doesn't feel like
    it. You hand the phone and walk off, feeling like your efforts were unrecognized.
  - You are cold and uncaring back, ignoring the happiness because of how subtle
    it is.
  - You start asking questions, confusing Leaf farther.... but you two have a good
    conversation after that.
