  encounterText: Despite how loud the music was on the floor, the DJ booth was surprisingly
    calm. This was mostly due to the DJ, who has pumping his fist to the music whenever
    he could have it free. As you approach, he puts his hands on his computer. "Oh
    hey there lil' one!" He says with a smooth voice that almost blends with the
    music. "You got anything for me?"

  responses:
  - You eagerly give him your request, yelling at a volume that chalenges the music
    itself. He smiles and starts pulling up options on his machine. "Alright! Got
    it queued!"
  - Not okay answer
  - You... were unable to hear him. What follows is you two trying to yell over the
    music, with you getting frustrated that he wouldn't turn it down. He kept mishearing
    you and you could not hear him. Luckily, you get your song queued up.
  - You ask if they have your request, knowing full well the song is rarely included
    in these machines. You make sure to spell out the song and band name. Surprisingly,
    they do have it. You smile as you walk away, knowing there is something to look
    forward to.
