Welcome to Overstimulation Simulation, a game designed to show life with a sensory processing disorder!

Control Emma, a woman on the spectrum, as you guide her through her to-do list.
Find items and interact with people, as a normal human would!

But watch out, if her stimulation meter gets to the top, it's game over.

Can you get through all the available levels?
